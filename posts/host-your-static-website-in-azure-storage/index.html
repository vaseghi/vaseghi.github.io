        <h2><a class="anchor" name="" href="#"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="copy-small">
            Static websites are getting more popular again with the increased using of Single Page Applications (SPA).
            They are
            a cheaper alternative to dynamic websites which need a backend. In the simplest form, they are more secure
            as there
            is no backend code. However, they could be fully-fledged websites which use JavaScript for client-side
            scripting and
            communicating with the backend using API and serverless architecture.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            Many free or low-cost static hosting options are available such as
            <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>
            ,

            and
            <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Azure</a>.
            In this
            article, I'm going to show you how to host your static website in Azure Storage.
        </p>

        <h2><a class="anchor" name="" href="#"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Prepare your environment
        </h2>
        <p class="copy-small">
            Before we start, you need to have an active
            <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/account/" target="_blank">Azure</a>
            account. I'm going to use
            <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest"
                target="_blank">
                Azure CLI
            </a>
            to provision resources in
            Azure so
            if you don't have it installed on your machine
            <a target="_blank"
                href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest">
                install
            </a>
            it from the Microsoft website.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            Verify your Azure CLI works by running <code>az</code> command in your terminal. Login to your account using
            <code>az login</code> and if you have
            multiple subscriptions on your account select the subscription you want to use for this tutorial:
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            1. Get the list of all your subscriptions and confirm if you want to continue with the default subscription:
        </p>

        <pre>az account list --output table</pre>

        <p class="copy-small">
            2. If you want to change you default subscription, use the following command with the subscription ID you
            want to
            switch
            to:
        </p>

        <pre>az account set --subscription SUBSCRIPTION_ID</pre>

        <p class="copy-small">
            <i>Note that some of the services we are going to create in this tutorial incur charges to your account.
                Remember to
                clean up your resources when you're done.</i>

            Step 1 - Create storage account
        </h2>

        <p class="copy-small">
            The first item we're going to create is a resource group so we can put all the resources in it. It helps us
            with the
            clean up as well since everything will be deleted when the resource group is deleted. Create a resource
            group using
            the following command:
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            <i>If you are using Powershell you need to replace "<code>\</code>" with "<code>`</code>" for multiline
                commands:</i>
        </p>

        <pre>az group create \
--location australiaeast \
--name staticwebsite-rg</pre>

        <p class="copy-small">
            Now, create a storage account which we are going to use for storing website assets. Run the following
            command to
            create it in your resource group:
        </p>

        <pre>az storage account create \
--name soheilstorage \
--resource-group staticwebsite-rg \
--location australiaeast \
--sku Standard_LRS</pre>

        <p class="copy-small">
            Azure storage by default doesn't serve your HTML files as a website. You need to enable this feature in your
            blob
            storage and specify <code>index</code> and <code>error</code> pages:
        </p>

        <pre>az storage blob service-properties update \
--account-name soheilstorage \
--static-website \
--404-document error.html \
--index-document index.html</pre>

        <p class="copy-small">
            It'll create a container called <code>$web</code> in your blob container so you can upload your
            <code>index.html</code> and <code>error.html</code>
            files. For uploading your website you can use Azure portal,
            <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/" target="_blank">Storage Explorer</a>
            or CLI command.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            I'm going to use Azure CLI to upload the content of my current terminal folder to blob storage using the
            following
            command:
        </p>

        <pre>az storage blob upload-batch \
--account-name soheilstorage \
--source . \
--destination '$web'</pre>

        <p class="copy-small">
            You can find the public URL of your website using the following command. Navigating to that URL would take
            to your
            website homepage.
        </p>

        <pre>az storage account show \
--name soheilstorage \
--resource-group staticwebsite-rg \
--query "primaryEndpoints.web" \
--output tsv</pre>

            Step 2 - Custom domain
        </h2>

        <p class="copy-small">
            As you saw, hosting your static website in Azure Storage is easy and straight forward. If you're happy to
            work with
            the Azure subdomain, you are done here and you can continue using it which supports HTTPS as well. But if
            you
            want to use your own domain name and map it to the storage account you need to take some extra steps which
            I'm going
            to elaborate on this section.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            You can map a custom domain to your static website in Azure using Storage Account or Azure Content Delivery
            Network
            (CDN).
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            Mapping a custom domain using storage account is easier but at the moment it only supports HTTP. I highly
            recommend
            against
            this approach unless you are aware of the
            <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/why-is-http-not-secure/" target="_blank">risks of not using
                HTTPS</a> and you want to take them.
            I'm not going to cover this approach but your can find the
            <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-custom-domain-name?tabs=azure-portal#map-a-custom-domain-with-only-http-enabled"
                target="_blank">instructions</a>
            in the Microsoft website.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            In this section I'm going to show you how to map a custom domain to your storage account using Azure CDN.

        </p>
        In this approach instead of hitting the storage account directly, requests get served from the CDN which caches
        contents from your table storage. It allows you to configure TLS/SSL certificates and, it
        supports rewrite rules. CDN caching has also great improvement on your website response time for static assets.

            2.1 - Create CDN
        </h3>

        <p class="copy-small">
            For creating CDN service in Azure you need two components: Azure CDN Profile and Azure CDN Endpoint.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            There are different types of CDNs available in Azure and pricing and features for each product is different.
            In this
            tutorial, we'll use "Standard Microsoft CDN". You can
            <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-features" target="_blank">compare</a>
            different CDN products on the Microsoft website. With a CDN profile we define the type of CDN we want to
            use.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            Run the following command to create a CDN Profile:
        </p>

        <pre>az cdn profile create \
--resource-group staticwebsite-rg \
--name staticwebsitecdn \
--sku Standard_Microsoft</pre>

        <p class="copy-small">
            And for using this CDN we need to have an endpoint which points to our website. Create the endpoint and set
            the
            origin to your storage URL:
        </p>

        <pre>az cdn endpoint create \
--resource-group staticwebsite-rg \
--name staticwebsitecdnendpoint \
--profile-name staticwebsitecdn \
--origin soheilstorage.z8.web.core.windows.net \
--origin-host-header soheilstorage.z8.web.core.windows.net</pre>

        <p class="copy-small">
            <i>Note that you need to set <code>origin-host-header</code> same as your origin which is your storage
                static
                website otherwise Azure CDN returns a 400 response.</i>
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            Now you should be able to access your website through CDN. However, CDN endpoint needs to cache your website
            content
            in different regions and this might take some time. You'll get a 404 response If you visit CDN URL
            immediately after
            you've
            created the endpoint so wait until propagation is finished.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            For getting the CDN endpoint URL use the following command:
        </p>

        <pre>az cdn endpoint show \
--resource-group staticwebsite-rg \
--profile-name staticwebsitecdn \
--name staticwebsitecdnendpoint</pre>

        <p class="copy-small">
            <code>host name</code> is your CDN endpoint URL.
        </p>

        <h3><a class="anchor" name="" href="#"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
            2.2 - Add a custom domain to your CDN
        </h3>

        <p class="copy-small">
            Before you add your custom domain to your CDN, Azure needs to know that you own the domain. To do that you
            need to
            create a canonical name (CNAME) record with your domain provider to point to your CDN endpoint. When you try
            to map
            a custom domain
            to your CDN, Azure will query your domain and verifies there is a CNAME record which points to the current
            CDN
            endpoint you are trying to add a custom domain to.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            This approach works great if you want to add a custom subdomain like <code>blog.soheilvaseghi.com</code> or
            <code>www.soheilvaseghi.com</code> but you won't be able to add CNAME for your apex zone or root domain
            (<code>soheilvaseghi.com</code>).

        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            Adding a CNAME record to the apex zone will create a broken zone and cause DNS resolution failure.
            You cannot also use <code>A</code> or <code>AAAA</code> DNS entries since they only accept IP addresses and
            Azure
            cannot use IP for
            verifying your domain ownership.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            To resolve this issue, Azure has suggested adding a temporary subdomain (<code>cdnverify</code>) which you
            can use
            for mapping
            root domains to Azure CDN. In this scenario when you map your custom root domain to the CDN, Azure will
            query
            <code>cdnverify.yourdomain.com</code> and if that entry exists and it points to the current endpoint, then
            it'll
            add the custom domain.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            So the first step is to decide if you want to use a subdomain or root domain for your website. If you want
            to use a
            subdomain, simply add it to your domain registrar DNS and resolve it to your CDN endpoint URL. I've used the
            following entry for my blog subdomain:
        </p>

        <pre>TYPE: CNAME
HOST: blog.soheilvaseghi.com
ANSWER: staticwebsitecdnendpoint.azureedge.net</pre>

        <p class="copy-small">
            And if you want to use your root domain add <code>cdnverify.yourdomain.com</code> to your DNS list. I've
            used the
            following
            entry to map my root domain:
        </p>

        <pre>TYPE: CNAME
HOST: cdnverify.soheilvaseghi.com
ANSWER: staticwebsitecdnendpoint.azureedge.net</pre>

        <p class="copy-small">
            <i>Note that the URL these records are pointing to is the CDN endpoint, not your table storage.</i>
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            It might take a while to propagate your DNS to name servers. You can check if your DNS has been propagated
            using
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.whatsmydns.net/">whatsmydns</a>
            website or <code>nslookup</code> command:
        </p>

        <pre>nslookup blog.soheilvaseghi.com</pre>

        <p class="copy-small">
            Next you need to add a custom domain to your CDN by running the following command:
        </p>

        <pre>az cdn custom-domain create \
--resource-group staticwebsite-rg \
--endpoint-name staticwebsitecdnendpoint \
--profile-name staticwebsitecdn \
--name blog \
--hostname blog.soheilvaseghi.com</pre>

        <p class="copy-small">
            Once completed, after a few seconds you should be able to navigate to your website using your custom domain.
        </p>

        <h3><a class="anchor" name="" href="#"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
            2.3 - Enable HTTPS for subdomains
        </h3>

        <p class="copy-small">
            Using HTTPS guarantees that data transfer between the client and server (CDN) is encrypted and secure. There
            are two
            approaches for enabling HTTPS on your custom domain: CDN managed certificate and using your own certificate.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            If you let CDN manage the certificate for you, Azure takes care of everything including provisioning a new
            certificate for you from one of the Certificate Authorities (CA). However, this approach only works for
            non-root
            domains. So only if your custom domain is a subdomain of your
            website you can use this approach.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            For enabling HTTPS for your custom subdomain run the following command:
        </p>

        <pre>az cdn custom-domain enable-https \
--endpoint-name staticwebsitecdnendpoint \
--name blog \
--profile-name staticwebsitecdn \
--resource-group staticwebsite-rg</pre>

        <p class="copy-small">
            <i>Note if you get <code>InvalidResource - The resource format is invalid.</code> error after running the
                above
                command,
                that's
                because of a bug in older Azure CLI versions and you need to update your Azure CLI.</i>
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            In this approach, Azure validates your domain using the same CNAME you've entered before. If it couldn't
            find the
            CNAME it'll send an email to one of your domains admin email addresses and you'll need to confirm domain
            ownership
            by verifying that email. Once the domain ownership is verified, it provisions a certificate for you and also
            renews
            that once the certificate is going to expire. This
            process may take up to a few hours. You can see the progress by navigating to your CDN endpoint custom
            domain in
            Azure portal.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">

        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            Once all the steps in you Azure portal got the green tick, your custom subdomain should be protected by TLS.
            In the
            next step, we'll see how to enable HTTPS for the root domains.
        </p>

        <h3><a class="anchor" name="" href="#"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
            2.4 - Enable HTTPS for root domains
        </h3>

        <p class="copy-small">
            This approach works for both root domains and subdomains. However, since it's more complex compared to the
            CDN
            managed method and you need to renew your certificate manually, I recommend using the CDN managed method if
            you are going to use a subdomain. Use this method only if you want your website to be accessible by your
            root
            domain.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            In this approach, you need to bring your own certificate hence you need to have access to your certificate
            files.
            Azure needs you to store your certificate in a Key Vault so CDN can access your certificate securely. Note
            that
            Azure CDN from Microsoft only supports a
            <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-troubleshoot-allowed-ca" target="_blacnk">subset</a>
            of CAs. If your certificate is not from one of these
            CAs you should use Azure CDN from Verizon which supports any valid CA.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            Run the following command to create an Azure Key Vault for storing your credentials:
        </p>

        <pre>az keyvault create \
--location australiaeast \
--name staticwebsitekeyvault \
--resource-group staticwebsite-rg</pre>

        <p class="copy-small">
            <i>
                Note that the Key Vault should be in the same resource group as your CDN Profile and CDN endpoint.
            </i>
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            You should grant CDN access to your Key Vault. To do that you need to be a global or application
            administrator in
            your account. First step is to register Azure CDN as an app in your Azure Active Directory using the
            following
            command:
        </p>

        <pre>az ad sp create \
--id "205478c0-bd83-4e1b-a9d6-db63a3e1e1c8"</pre>

        <p class="copy-small">
            And grant access to your Key Vault by:
        </p>

        <pre>az keyvault set-policy \
--name staticwebsitekeyvault \
--spn {NAME_OF_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL} \
--secret-permissions get</pre>

        <p class="copy-small">
            Now, Azure CDN can get certificates from your Key Vault. You need to push your certificate to your Key
            Vault. Make
            sure
            to include all intermediate certificates as well as your private key in one file. Use the following command
            to
            import your certificate to the Key Vault:
        </p>

        <pre>az keyvault certificate import \
--file cert.pem \
--name mysitecertificate \
--vault-name staticwebsitekeyvault</pre>

        <p class="copy-small">
            You'll need your certificate secret version which you can find in the response of the previous command:
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            <img src="img/02.png" alt="certificate secret version">
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            Finally, you can enable HTTPS using your own certificate imported in the Key Vault by running the following
            command:
        </p>

        <pre>az cdn custom-domain enable-https \
--endpoint-name staticwebsitecdnendpoint \
--name blog \
--profile-name staticwebsitecdn \
--resource-group staticwebsite-rg \
--user-cert-vault-name staticwebsitekeyvault \
--user-cert-secret-name mysitecertificate \
--user-cert-secret-version 86cb1d1337cb471aa99b4761e8b05ed1</pre>

        <p class="copy-small">
            This process might take a couple of hours. Once finished successfully you should be able to visit your root
            domain
            using HTTPS pointing to your static website stored in Azure Storage. In the next step, we'll add a rewrite
            rule to
            enforce using HTTPS version of your site.
        </p>

        <h2><a class="anchor" name="" href="#"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
            Step 3 - Enforce HTTPS
        </h2>

        <p class="copy-small">
            In this section I'm going to add a rewrite rule to redirects all HTTP requests to the HTTPS version.
            However, this
            instruction is
            for Microsoft Standard CDN and if you've used a different CDN Profile it could be different.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            Run the following command to add a rule to your Azure CDN endpoint to redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS:
        </p>

        <pre>az cdn endpoint rule add \
--resource-group staticwebsite-rg \
--name staticwebsitecdnendpoint \
--profile-name staticwebsitecdn \
--order 1 \
--rule-name enforceHTTPS \
--match-variable RequestScheme \
--operator Equal \
--match-values HTTP \
--action-name UrlRedirect \
--redirect-protocol Https \
--redirect-type Moved</pre>

        <p class="copy-small">
            <i>Note that currently this command is in preview and it may change in future CLI release.</i>
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            Now if you navigate to the HTTP version of your website, it'll use a <code>301</code> response code to
            redirect you to the HTTPS version.
        </p>

        <h2><a class="anchor" name="" href="#"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
            Deploy updates
        </h2>

        <p class="copy-small">
            When you use CDN you need to be aware that everytime you
            upload a new file to your storage account, the CDN is not aware of these changes. You have to explicitly
            tell the
            CDN
            to refresh its cache and get the new version of the files. You can specify only the files that's been
            changed but in
            the following command I'll purge everything:
        </p>

        <pre>az cdn endpoint purge \
--resource-group staticwebsite-rg \
--name staticwebsitecdnendpoint \
--profile-name staticwebsitecdn \
--no-wait \
--content-paths '/'</pre>

        <p class="copy-small">
            In this command, we used <code>--no-wait</code> flag so the command returns quickly but behind the scenes,
            this
            process may take up a few minutes. You have to wait until the CDN cache is refreshed for all the nodes then
            you will
            be able to see
            the changes on your website.
        </p>

            Conclusion
        </h2>

        <p class="copy-small">
            In this article, we saw how to host our static website in Azure Storage which is a cheaper alternative
            compared to
            virtual machines or Azure Web App hosting options. It doesn't need any server maintenance and you can focus
            entirely on your website rather than the infrastructure. However, since currently, Azure Storage doesn't
            support
            HTTPS
            for custom domains, securing your website on your own domain using SSL/TLS involves extra steps for adding a
            CDN and
            Key Vault.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            If you are going to use a subdomain for your website, the process is fairly straight forward but it becomes
            more
            complex if you want to use your root domain since Azure doesn't support automatic certificate provisioning
            for root
            domains yet.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-small">
            In most cases, you'll do this once for your website so it doesn't trouble too much to take some extra
            steps to host your website.
